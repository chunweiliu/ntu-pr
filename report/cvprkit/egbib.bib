    abstract = {In this work, we present a novel approach to face recognition which considers both shape and texture information to represent face images. The face area is first divided into small regions from which Local Binary Pattern (LBP) histograms are extracted and concatenated into a single, spatially enhanced feature histogram efficiently representing the face image. The recognition is performed using a nearest neighbour classifier in the computed feature space with Chi square as a dissimilarity measure. Extensive experiments clearly show the superiority of the proposed scheme over all considered methods (PCA, Bayesian Intra/extrapersonal Classifier and Elastic Bunch Graph Matching) on FERET tests which include testing the robustness of the method against different facial expressions, lighting and aging of the subjects. In addition to its efficiency, the simplicity of the proposed method allows for very fast feature extraction.},

@inproceedings{Turk1991,
    abstract = {An approach to the detection and identification of human faces is presented, and a working, near-real-time face recognition system which tracks a subject's head and then recognizes the person by comparing characteristics of the face to those of known individuals is described. This approach treats face recognition as a two-dimensional recognition problem, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. Face images are projected onto a feature space (`face space') that best encodes the variation among known face images. The face space is defined by the `eigenfaces', which are the eigenvectors of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to isolated features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The framework provides the ability to learn to recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner},
